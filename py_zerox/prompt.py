- File pages are well organized, their structure should be preserved in the output format.
- Each page should return a single document section with all the page's content as subsections inside it.
- Use consistent section keys for all pages
- Pages can contain one or more titles with nested subtitles, their relationship should be well respected.
- Pages can contain single column or multicolumn text
- Pages can contain lists in a bullet point, numeric, or any format. Try to use a unified format for them. 
- Pages can contain one or more tables, with or without additional text that doesnâ€™t belong to the table. 
- For each table, identify its content and caption. 
- If the page contains tables and paragraphs, return both. 
"""

- You mistake tables for sections and subsections. Make sure to identify tables and sections separately.
- Some two-column texts have line-wide tables, and vice versa. Do not be confused by it. 
- Avoid removing an entire column and pretend that is doesn't exist
- Avoid forgetting   begin documt and end document latex tags
