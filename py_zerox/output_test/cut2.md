\section{MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS}

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward-looking statements.

\subsection{Company Overview}
MBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc., a New York corporation (“MBC”), and were formed in December 2015 specifically for the purpose of the initial public offering (“IPO”) of the Notes (described below). On April 25, 2016, we sold $6,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 6% Senior Secured Notes, due April 22, 2026 (the “Notes”), in our IPO for net proceeds of $5,200,000, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Notes are secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets, including, primarily, mortgages, notes, mortgages and other transaction documents entered into in connection with first mortgage loans originated and funded by MBC, which were acquired from MBC pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes (the “Indenture”), the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by us, together with our cash on hand, must always equal at least 120\% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times until the Notes are paid in full. In addition, MBC has guaranteed our obligations under the Notes and has secured that guarantee with a pledge of all of our outstanding common shares.

The Notes are listed on the NYSE American and trade under the symbol “LOAN.”

\subsection{Results of Operations}

\subsubsection{Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023}
\textbf{Total Revenue}

Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately \$229,000 and \$227,000, respectively, representing interest income on the loans that we purchased from MBC.

\subsubsection{Interest and amortization of deferred financing costs}
Interest and amortization of deferred financing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately \$109,000 are attributable to the issuance of the Notes.

\subsubsection{General and administrative expenses}
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately \$40,000 are comprised of fees paid to the indenture trustee and NYSE American LLC, as well as bank fees.

\section{Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023}

\subsection{Total Revenue}
Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately \$693,000 and \$659,000, respectively, represent interest income on the secured commercial loans that we purchased from MBC. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher interest rates charged on such loans due to market conditions at the time the loans were originated or extended.

\subsection{Interest and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs}
Interest and amortization of deferred financing costs for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately \$326,000 are attributable to the issuance of the Notes.

\subsection{General and Administrative Expenses}
General and administrative expenses for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of approximately \$12,000 are comprised of fees paid to the Indenture trustee and NYSE American LLC, as well as bank fees.

\subsection{Liquidity and Capital Resources}
At September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately \$48,000 compared to cash of approximately \$40,000 at December 31, 2023.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately \$406,000, compared to approximately \$368,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities mainly resulted from the increase in revenue. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from our interest income and amortization of deferred financing costs.

Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately \$399,000, compared to approximately \$365,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the increase in net income. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflected excess cash to MBC for working capital and general corporate purposes. Amounts advanced to MBC are non-interest bearing and due on demand.

We had no cash provided by or used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans held by the Company, together with the Company’s cash on hand, must always equal at least 120\% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes at all times.

We anticipate that operating together with our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months.
